# MATLAB scripts
For my thesis presentation in 2016 I needed to show animated plots but could not find proper tutorials online on how to do this. That's why I made my own script and uploaded a tutorial on YouTube. Unfortunately, I am not MATLAB-active anymore but I am open to suggestions or questions about MATLAB! Just email me at chrryy@gmail.
